Brief Description:
Any up bar which closes in the middle OR Low, especially if the Volume has fallen off,
is a potential sign of weakness.

Things to Look Out for:
if the market is still strong, you will normally see signs of strength in the next few bars,
which will most probably show itself as a:
* Down bar with a narrow spread, closing in the middle OR High.
* Down bar on Low Volume.","");
